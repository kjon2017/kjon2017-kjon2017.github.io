                    Ramen is a noodle soup dish that was originally imported from China and has become one of the most popular dishes in
                    Japan in recent decades. Ramen are inexpensive and widely available, two factors that also make them an ideal option for
                    budget travelers. Ramen restaurants, or ramen-ya, can be found in virtually every corner of the country and produce countless
                    regional variations of this common noodle dish.
                </p>
                <h3>Popular ramen types</h3>
                <p>
                    Ramen are typically categorized according to their soup base, although variations that combine the different bases
                    are not uncommon. The main types of soup are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Shoyu (Soy Sauce)</li>
                        <li>Shio (Salt)</li>
                        <li>Miso (Soybean Paste) </li>
                        <li>Tonkotsu (Pork Bone) </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h3>Hiyashi chūka ("Chilled Chinese") </h3>
                <p>
                    Hiyashichuka is a Japanese dish consisting of chilled ramen noodles with various toppings served in the summer. It is
                    also called reimen ("chilled noodle") in Kansai region and hiyashi rāmen ("chilled ramen") in Hokkaido. Toppings are
                    usually colorful cold ingredients and a tare sauce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Popular toppings are strips of tamagoyaki (egg omelette), carrot, cucumber, ginger, ham, and chicken, or may also
                    contain barbecued pork. The tare sauce is usually made from water, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and
                    sesame seeds.

                <h2>Soba and Udon noodles</h2>
                <p>
                    Soba noodles are noodles made of buckwheat flour, roughly as thick as spaghetti, and prepared in various hot and cold
                    dishes. Soba dishes are very popular and easily available nationwide. As 100% buckwheat soba noodles tend to be brittle,
                    many restaurants add some wheat flour when preparing their noodles. Depending on the shop, the percentage of buckwheat
                    flour in soba noodles typically ranges between 40% and 100%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note also that there are a few noodle dishes named soba (e.g. yakisoba, chukasoba or Okinawa Soba) that are not made
                    with buckwheat noodles. More often than not, however, "soba" refers to buckwheat noodles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Udon are thick Japanese noodles made of wheat flour. They are thicker than soba noodles, white and chewier.

                    <h3>Popular soba and udon dishes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Soba and Udon can be served either hot or cold.

                    <h4> Mori/Zaru Soba/Udon (cold)</h4>

                    <p>
                        The most basic kind of chilled soba/udon served on a tray with a simple chilled dipping sauce (tsuyu) served on
                        the side. The dipping sauce is usually a mixture of soup stock, water and mirin. There are historical differences
                        between Zaru and Mori soba/udon. However in recent times, one major difference between the two is zaru soba/udon
                        has nori seaweed on top of the soba noodles while mori soba/udon does not.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Kake Soba/Udon (hot)</h4>

                        Soba/Udon noodles served in a bowl of hot, clear broth. The broth is made of the same components as the dipping
                        sauce for the chilled soba/udon, but in a lower concentration.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>Kitsune Soba/udon (hot/cold) </h4>
                <p>
                    Kitsune Soba/Udon comes with a piece of aburaage, thin sheets of fried tofu, on top of the soba noodles. When
                    in Osaka, if you wanted soba with a piece of aburaage on top, you will have to ask for Tanuki Soba/Udon instead.
                    (Kitsune means Fox and Tanuki means Japanese raccoon dog in Japanese. There are various theories why the dishes
                    are named like that.)
                </p>

                <h4> Tanuki Soba/Udon (hot/cold) </h4>
                <p>
                    Tanuki Soba/Udon is served with a helping of tenkasu, crunchy bits of leftover fried tempura batter. In Osaka,
                    the same soba with a helping of tenkasu is known as Haikara Soba/Udon.
                </p>
                <h4>Tempura Soba/Udon (hot/cold) </h4>
                <p>
                    This noodle dish comes with a serving of tempura either on the side or on top of the noodles. There are usually
                    three to five different kinds of tempura pieces, and the ingredients varies from shop to shop. The noodles are
                    served either on a tray or in a soup.
                </p>
                <h4> Tsukimi Soba/Udon (hot)</h4>
                <p>
                    The literal translation of Tsukimi is "moon watching" and hence, Tsukimi Soba/Udon has a raw egg which is
                    supposed to resemble the moon.

                <h2>Somen</h2>
                <p>
                    Sōmen are very thin white Japanese noodles made of wheat flour, less than 1.3 mm in diameter. The noodles are usually served cold.
                    The noodles' diameter is the chief distinction between sōmen and the thicker wheat noodles hiyamugi and Japanese wheat noodles udon.
                    Sōmen noodles are stretched when made, as are some types of udon noodles. The dough is stretched with the help of vegetable oil to
                    make very thin strips and then air dried.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sōmen are usually served cold with a light flavored dipping sauce or tsuyu. The tsuyu is usually a katsuobushi-based
                    sauce that can be flavored with Japanese bunching onion, ginger, or myoga. In the summer, sōmen chilled with ice is a
                    popular meal to help stay cool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sōmen served in hot soup is usually called "nyumen" and eaten in the winter, much as soba or udon are.S

                <p>
                    Hiyamugi are wheat flour noodles similar to sōmen and udon noodles and somewhere in between the two in size. These noodles
                    are often served in the same manner as sōmen and udon noodles. While they are mostly white, there are bundles mixed with
                    noodles of pinkish or brown hues.

                    Yakisoba ([jakʲiꜜsoba]), literally "fried buckwheat," or sōsu yakisoba ([soːsɯ̥ jakʲiꜜsoba]) (the same, but in sauce).
                    It first appeared in food stalls in Japan during the early 20th century. Although soba means buckwheat, typically
                    suggesting noodles made from that flour in mainland Japan, yakisoba noodles are made from wheat flour. It is typically
                    flavored with a condiment similar to oyster sauce.
