                <h2>Rice Dishes</h2>
                <p>
                    For over 2000 years, rice has been the most important food in Japanese cuisine. Despite changes in eating
                    patterns over the last few decades and slowly decreasing rice consumption in recent years, rice remains one of
                    the most important ingredients in Japan today.

                <h2>Noodle Dishes</h2>
                <p>
                    There are various traditional Japanese noodle dishes as well as some dishes which were introduced to Japan and
                    subsequently Japanized. Noodle dishes are very popular in Japan, and are served both hot and cold depending on the
                    season. Noodle restaurants and food stands are ubiquitous, and it is common to find noodle stands along train platforms.

                <p class="copied">The following paragraph is copied from <a href="https://www.thedailymeal.com/japanese-food-what-agemono"><cite>Japanese Food: What is Agemono?</cite></a> on <time datetime="2018-07-18">07/18/2017</time></p>
                <p>
                    Deep-fried Japanese food is called agemono. There are many different types of agemono. Karaage is bite-sized meat
                    and seafood that is floured and deep-fried. Often, this type of Japanese food can be found in convenience stores around
                    Japan and can also be found at izakaya, or Japanese drinking establishments.

                <h3>Teppanyaki</h3>
                <p>
                    Meat, seafood and vegetables are prepared on a large iron griddle (teppan) around which the diners are seated. The chef
                    artfully prepares the dishes in front of his customers.
                </p>
                <h3>Nabe Dishes</h3>
                <p>
                    Nabe, or hot pot dishes, are prepared in a hot pot, usually at the table. Typical ingredients are vegetables such as
                    negi (Japanese leek) and hakusai (Chinese cabbage), various mushrooms, seafood and/or meat. There are many regional and
                    personal varieties, and they are especially popular in the cold winter months.
