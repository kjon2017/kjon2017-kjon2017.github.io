                    Tempura (tenpura, [tẽ̞mpɯᵝra]) is a classical Portuguese dish brought to and popularized by Japan, consisting of seafood 
                or vegetables that have been battered and deep fried. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tempura is commonly served with grated daikon and eaten hot immediately after frying. In Japan, it is often found in 
                    bowls of soba or udon soup often in the form of a shrimp, shiso leaf, or fritter. The most common sauce is tentsuyu 
                    sauce (roughly three parts dashi, one part mirin, and one part shoyu). Alternatively, tempura may be sprinkled with sea
                    salt before eating. Mixtures of powdered green tea and salt or yuzu and salt are also used.

                    <h3>Kakiage</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kakiage is a type of tempura made with mixed vegetable strips, such as onion, carrot, and burdock, and sometimes
                        including shrimp or squid, which are deep fried as small round fritters.

                    Karaage (approximately KAH-rah-AH-ge in English), is a Japanese cooking technique in which various foods—most often 
                    chicken, but also other meat and fish—are deep fried in oil. The process involves optional marinating small pieces of 
                    the food in a sauce, then lightly coating it with a seasoned wheat flour or potato starch mix, and frying in a light 
                    oil. It is similar in technique to the preparation of tempura.

                    Korokke is the Japanese name for a deep-fried dish originally related to a French dish, the croquette. Korokke is made
                    by mixing cooked chopped meat, seafood, or vegetables with mashed potato or white sauce, usually shaped like a flat 
                    patty, rolling it in wheat flour, eggs, and Japanese style breadcrumbs, then deep-frying this until brown on the outside.

                    Tonkatsu (pork cutlet), is a Japanese dish which consists of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet. There are two main types, 
                    fillet and loin. It is often served with shredded cabbage.

                    Tonkatsu is also popular as a sandwich filling (katsu sando) or served on Japanese curry (katsu karē). Tonkatsu is 
                    sometimes served with egg on a big bowl of rice as katsudon.
