                    A bowl of plain cooked rice is served with most Japanese meals. For breakfast, it is sometimes mixed with a raw egg
                    and soy sauce (tamago kake gohan) or enjoyed with natto or other toppings.

                    Sushi may refer to any dish that contains sushi rice, cooked white rice flavored with seasoned rice vinegar. There are
                    various kinds of sushi dishes, such as nigirizushi (hand formed sushi), makizushi (rolled sushi), and chirashi (sushi
                    rice topped with raw fish). Sushi is the most famous Japanese dish outside of Japan, and one of the most popular dishes
                    among the Japanese themselves.

                    Donburi refers to a bowl of plain cooked rice with some other food on top of it. Donburi are served at specialty
                    restaurants, but they are also a common dish that can be found on all kinds of restaurants' menus. Some of the most
                    popular varieties are gyudon (stewed beef), katsudon (tonkatsu), tendon (tempura), oyakodon (chicken and egg), tekkadon
                    (maguro), and kaisendon (raw seafood).

                    Rice balls, or Onigiri, are made of cooked rice and are usually wrapped in nori seaweed. They are usually lightly
                    seasoned with salt and often contain a filling such as umeboshi (pickled Japanese plum), okaka (dried bonito shavings
                    and konbu), or salmon. Rice balls are a popular and inexpensive portable snack available at convenience stores, but are
                    also commonly served at general restaurants and izakaya.

                <p>
                    Despite common misconceptions, onigiri is not a form of sushi. Onigiri is made with plain rice (sometimes lightly salted),
                    while sushi is made of rice with vinegar, sugar and salt. Onigiri makes rice portable and easy to eat as well as
                    preserving it, while sushi originated as a way of preserving fish.

                    Kare Raisu (Curry Rice) is cooked rice with a Japanese curry sauce. It can be served with additional toppings such as
                    tonkatsu. Curry is not a native Japanese spice, but has been used in Japan for over a century. Kare Raisu is a very popular
                    dish, and many inexpensive Kare Raisu restaurants can be found especially in and around train stations.

                    Fried rice, or chahan, is a dish that was originally introduced from China. There are an infinite variety of ingredients
                    that can be added to fried rice. Some common ones are peas, egg, green onions (negi), carrots and pork. Chahan is a suitable
                    dish for using left over rice.

                    Chazuke, or ochazuke, is another simple comfort food consisting of hot water, tea, or light fish stock poured over rice
                    (sometimes made with leftover rice). Chazuke is often garnished with toppings such as umeboshi, grilled salmon, or pickles.
                    Chazuke is commonly served at izakaya, and is a popular dish to eat after drinking.

                    Kayu, or okayu, is Japanese rice porridge made by slow cooking rice in lots of water. It tends to be thicker than other
                    types of rice porridge or gruel, and is a suitable dish for using left over rice. Kayu is often garnished with umeboshi,
                    and is commonly served to sick people because it is easily digestible.

                    Mochi is Japanese rice cake made of mochigome, a short-grain japonica glutinous rice. The rice is
                    pounded into paste and molded into the desired shape. In Japan it is traditionally made in a ceremony called mochitsuki.
                    While also eaten year-round, mochi is a traditional food for the Japanese New Year and is commonly sold and eaten during
                    that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though mochi is often consumed alone as a major component of a main meal, it is often used as an ingredient in many other
                    prepared foods such as for confectionery or soup.
